UnZip version 4.2, 20 March 1992

New features, you betcha:

 - directories now created by default (was only with "-d" option); new "-j"
    option to junk directory names [CN]
 - "-n" option for never overwriting existing files (opposite of -o) [CN]
 - "-u" option (update: at last!) from Kai Uwe Rommel, just like zip's
    update option, but in reverse
 - "-f" option (freshen) to complement -u; VMS support for both [CN]
 - option to rename extracted file if already exists (another much-wanted
    improvement!) [Kai]
 - option to set "-n" (never overwrite) in middle of processing zipfile [CN]
 - (uncompressed) symbolic links extracted under Unix [Mark Adler]
 - international date formats for DOS, OS/2 [Jon Saxton]
 - trailing ^Z now removed with -a option under Unix/VMS/etc. [CN]
 - decryption (uses existing crypt.c from zip 1.0) [big thanks to Mark and
    Jean-loup!]
 - OS/2:  longnames now saved into EA DATA. SF on FAT disk [Kai Uwe Rommel]
 - OS/2 2.0:  IBM C Set/2 and GNU C/emx 32-bit compilers supported [Kai]
 - OS/2, MS-DOS:  "-b" option (blanks) to allow writing of filenames with
    blanks (like EA DATA. SF, above) on FAT disks [CN]
 - Mac:  Aztec C port; new makefiles for Aztec C and MPW C [Antoine Verheijen]
 - Amiga:  several compilers supported (possibly--not tested) [Paul Wells,
    Georg Sassen]
 - Atari:  patches to UnZip 4.1 + support files [Martin Schulz]
 - VMS:  new makefile command files for GNU C [Mike Freeman]
 - VMS:  major improvements to handling of VMS file attributes [Igor
    Mandrichenko]
 - major restructuring of extraction code, prompted by rename and VMS patches
    [CN, Igor Mandrichenko]
 - usage info goes to stdout if just "unzip" specified; otherwise to stderr
    as before (allows redirection under MS-DOS) [CN]
 - testing info with quiet flag (unzip -tq) identifies zipfile being tested and
    reports number of files skipped--for background or batch processing [CN]
 - several new systems supported, including Minix (type "make list") [various]
 - new ZipInfo [CN] and Ship [Mark] utility programs
 - new (but incomplete) COPYING and CONTRIBS files to give credit where
    credit due (let us know if you're not in there and should be).
 - assorted other new files (like BUGS, so you know what's still screwed up :-)

Bugs fixed:

 - HP, others:  FILENAME_MAX=14, not 256 or whatever:  paths truncated [CN,
    with much prodding from Jean-loup Gailly :-) ]
 - VMS:  filenames longer than 31 characters get truncated? [seems to have
    gotten fixed by itself, or else side effect from FILENAME_MAX]
 - check expected offset vs. actual and compensate (bogus MacBinary headers,
    etc.); indicate file transfer errors [CN, Jean-loup]
 - ifdef sco, skip <param.h> (redefinitions) [CN]
 - ifdef typedef byte:  some systems (just Bull?) have predefined [CN]
 - Unix:  blanks no longer converted to underlines [CN, Mark]
 - DOS (& OS/2?):  fatal write error if file to be unzipped is read-only [Kai?]
 - DOS (& OS/2?):  if out of disk space, unzip hangs hard [CN, usually works:
    see comments in BUGS, however!]
 - DOS:  decryption with Borland C was broken [David Kirschbaum]
 - DOS & OS/2:  dos2unix() was not used; commented out [David]
 - decryption key was doubly defined [David]
 - file creation (actually deletion) error if file exists but not owned by us;
    try unlinking, report error [Cliff Stanford]
 - VMS:  MMS file needs an odd space [Joel Aycock]
 - PK signature strings encoded so unzip executable doesn't look like a zipfile
    [CN]
 - Makefile and code simplified to remove non-NOTINT16 stuff (fewer false bug
    reports that way) [CN]
 - changed all ?? and ??? comments to avoid possible ANSI trigraph warnings
    (except one string in zipinfo.c) [CN]
 - Turbo C++ 1.0:  fixed problem with missing _MAX_PATH [CN]

==================

These changes occurred in various versions, from 4.10a to 4.10x and 4.20a to
4.20x.  UnZip 4.11 was an incomplete (and somewhat incorrect) beta version.
Anyway, I have no idea what versions correspond to what features (except that
decryption appeared in 4.20n); it's not particularly relevant, since they
were all internal versions anyway.

More important is the fact that this list undoubtedly leaves out many bug-
fixes and even some features which have been added; apologies to anyone who
may inadvertently been slighted.  Let us know, eh?  It's been too long...

Helloooo, David...Earth to David...yoooo hooooo....   Hmmm...must be out for
the moment.  We'll check back in with him for the next release!
