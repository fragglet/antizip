  ship.dif      patch to allow ship to be compiled with IBM C Set/2 (32-bit)

Make targets for OS/2 are provided in other makefiles.  For MSC 6.0 or later
and NMAKE, or for IBM C Set/2, or for GNU C and Eberhard Mattes' EMX environ-
ment, use the main (Unix) Makefile and its msc_os2, ship_os2 and zi_os2 (or
icc_os2, ship_icc and zi_icc, or gcc_os2, ship_gcc and zi_gcc, respectively)
targets.  For MSC 5.1 and possibly 5.0, use the makefile in the MSDOS sub-
archive (edit appropriately).  There is, as yet, no support for the Zortech
compiler, and the Borland OS/2 compiler doesn't exist yet.

Note about the ship patch:  *only* use it for the 32-bit IBM compiler; it
will break under Microsoft C.  The same problem *may* occur with the IBM
compiler--namely, that stdin and stdout are not treated as binary file han-
dles, with the result that piping things into and out of ship won't work 
right.  This has to do with the reliance on fopen() to set the binary mode,
rather than the original setmode().  (It may have been intended to use
fdopen() for this, rather than fopen().)
