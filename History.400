v4.01, 4 Dec 90:

From: aas@cc.uq.oz.au

The makefile.msc as it stands more or less works for TurboC 2.0,
so makefile.tc is probably redundant.  However, TurboC throws what
we colloquially call a `wobbly' over one line in file_io.c: where
`>> (space) =' is used instead of the ANSI `>>=' construct.  The
fix is easy (appended).

[Makefile.msc patched to include both Turbo C and MSC compiles,
 renamed to MAKEFILE.DOS.  Actually, it's for OS/2 also.
 Works just fine for Turbo C v2.0, can't test the others.
 Removed MAKEFILE.TC.
]

And the file_io.c patch was a one-liner at line 312 /318:
!     bitbuf >> = bits;
changed to:
!     bitbuf >>= bits;

But enough of that...on to REALLY amusing topics.  Firstly, there *was*
a patch to 3.99 which you missed and I forgot about:  the name[STRSIZ]
one in mapname.c.
[Extracted to mapname.pch, mapname.c patched.]

Secondly, Mr. Mangler did some weird things to some of the comments in 
one of the files (misc.c?  mapname.c?)--things like /****/ became /*** */,
and many of my partially indented comments got indented even further. 
I'll take care of the latter problem with the new seek patch, since there
are a number of other changes to do_string() (the function where I noticed 
it).

[Mr. Mangler is indent11.c C source file unifier.  We went manually
 into the source to remove all the right-padded comments, etc.
 Then we ran Mr. Mangler against all the source to "standardize"
 indentation.
]

Thirdly, looks like Mr. Mangler likes tabs, which is going to play hell 
with patches, if not the final beta versions--i.e., those using tab-converting
editors and who DON'T have indent.c are probably going to post some weird-
looking patches.  Whatever.  Speaking of which, however, what settings are
you using?  Just so *I* can be compatible, at least.

[I'm using indent11 with the "-kr" settings.
 And all source will be archived with NO tabs.
 Except for the stupid makefiles, however
]

Fourthly, "makefile.msc" should have been uppercase; I suspect that stems
from the "Unix" zipfile I once sent you, in which I edited the central-
directory names for 2 or 3 late updates, but forgot to go fix the local-
header names.  Not a big deal, obviously.

[It's MAKEFILE.DOS now because of TC/MSC/OS2 integration.]

Fifthly, your man page still says "3.1" at the top and has a weird (old)
e-mail address for you at the bottom (also attached to the 3.0 or 3.1 version
number).
[unzip.1 edited to reflect "4.0".]

Oh yeah, the comments at the top of unzip.c say "unzip40.tar.Z" rather than
"unzip400".
[Fixed]
-----------------
Final 4.01 Toad Hall Note:
- Compiling in Turbo C integrated environment (e.g., using the .PRJ
  file) produced an UNZIP.EXE a couple hundred bytes smaller than the
  one compiled via tcc and the MAKEFILE.DOS.  Obviously I've forgotten
  a switch somewhere, or my default tcc settings are slightly off.
  So if you want the absolute smallest, suggest integrated compile.
- No more stupid mixing of Unix and DOS text files.  EVERYTHING's gonna
  have (1) no tabs and (2) Unix LF line endings.  If you're gonna work
  in DOS, you'd better have FLIP or TOADCRLF or some such to convert
  these Unix files.
  We'll still indicate DOS files vs. Unix files via name case (e.g.,
  DOS files'll be all uppercase).  Of course, the VMS files are ALSO
  uppercase (meant to ask you about that, Cave Newt), but that's ok.
  For the DENSA members, anything starting with VMS is NOT DOS, ok?
