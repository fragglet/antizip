Note:  despite the similarity in names to the corresponding Turbo C files,
the Borland C++ files apparently are NOT compatible with the older compilers
(although they seem to be compatible with Turbo C++).  Such was the claim of
one of our testers, at least.  So the old TC makefiles are also included.  I 
have tried to update them appropriately, but I don't know for sure that they 
work.  The ZipInfo project file needs to specify that misc.c be compiled with
-DZIPINFO (it might work as it stands, but the executable will be unnecessarily
large).

Note also:  for MSC 6.0 or later, use the msc_dos, zi_dos and ship_dos (or
msc_os2, zi_os2 and ship_os2) targets in the main Unix Makefile--with NMAKE,
not MAKE.  The msc_dos target is very close to the DOS 128-character command-
line limit--124 characters, if -DCRYPT and -FPi87 are among the CFLAGS--but
it should work.  If it's too long, remove the -nologo from CFLAGS (and, option-
ally, the /nol from LDFLAGS).  The compile will be slightly "noisier," but no
harm is done.
