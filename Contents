Files marked "required*" are also needed to compile ZipInfo.  There are
Unix, OS/2 and MS-DOS targets to make ZipInfo near the bottom of Makefile
(zipinfo, zi_dos, zi_os2, zi_gcc, zi_icc).  The sub-archives are marked
either "CR LF" or "LF" to indicate the line-endings format of the contained
text files.

The file ship.c is the stand-alone source file for the ship utility, a 
program for ASCII-encoding, splitting, e-mailing, and decoding binaries
(similar to uuencode/uudecode but far more useful).  This is the preferred
format for sending/receiving zipfiles to and from zip-bugs and Info-ZIP.
Instructions on how to use it are included in the comments near the top
of ship.c, and there are Unix, OS/2 and DOS makefile targets in Makefile
(sorry, we haven't got this fully integrated into all the other sub-
archives).  Ship is more fully supported in the Zip distribution; if
you've already got it from there, you don't need to make it again.

The Atari ST support is in the form of patches against UnZip 4.1; there
are more details in the ATARI sub-archive Contents file.  Amiga support
has not been tested since version 4.1 or earlier (the makefiles, however,
have been updated to reflect the new code structure, and any changes
required shouldn't be TOO extensive; maybe--dare we say it?--none...).

Encryption and decryption code for both Zip and UnZip (the only file
required for UnZip is crypt.c) is available from the following sites
(the filenames may differ slightly, if later versions become available):
   
   From the US:
      pit-manager.mit.edu:/pub/zip/crypt/zipcrypt.shar
         (mail server at mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu)
      wuarchive.wustl.edu:/mirrors3/garbo.uwasa.fi/arcutil/zcrypt10.zip
   Outside the US:
      garbo.uwasa.fi:/pc/arcutil/zcrypt10.zip
      ftp.win.tue.nl:/pub/compression/zip/zcrypt10.zip
      ftp.inria.fr:/system/arch-compr/zcrypt10.zip
      ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de:/pub/utils/archiver/zcrypt10.zip
         (mail server at ftp-mailer@ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de)

Non-US users, please do NOT ftp from the US site (US regulations and
all that).  Likewise, US users, please do not ftp from the European
sites (it's not illegal, but it sure is a waste of expensive bandwidth).
If someone repackages zipcrypt.shar or zcrypt10.zip as a VMS .share
file and places it on a VMS archive site somewhere, please let us know
(send e-mail to zip-bugs at the address listed in README).  Likewise 
for Mac- or Atari-specific formats (or any others).
