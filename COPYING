  Copyright in unimplod.c (and UnZip in general?), claimed retroactively by 
  Carl Mascott, cmascott@world.std.com, 7 November 1991:

     Portions copyright (C) 1989 Carl Mascott.  All rights reserved.

     profit or included with other software that is sold for profit,

  Also noted by Carl Mascott:

     The following routines in unimplod.c were written entirely by me:
          SortLengths
          GenerateTrees
          ReadTree

  Original notes from unzip 2.0a:

     * 12/14/89  C. Mascott  2.0a   adapt for UNIX
     *              ifdef HIGH_LOW swap bytes in time, date, CRC,
     *                version needed, bit flag
     *              implement true s-f trees instead of table
     *              don't pre-allocate output file space
     *              implement -t, -v, member file specs
     *              buffer all input
     *              change hsize_array_integer to short
     *              overlap storage used by different comp. methods
     *              speed up unImplode
     *              use insertion sort in SortLengths
     *              define zipfile header structs in a way that
     *                avoids structure padding on 32-bit machines
     *              fix "Bad CRC" msg: good/bad CRCs were swapped
     *              check for write error on output file

  Additional copyright information:

     BILF (distributed with the VMS stuff) is copyrighted by Rahul Dhesi,
     but it is freely distributable.

     The functions extract_or_test_files() and store_info() in extract.c,
     do_string() and return_VMS() in misc.c, VMS version of echo() in
     file_io.c, and find_end_central_dir() in unzip.c, were written by
     Greg Roelofs and subsequently modified by many others via Info-ZIP.
     I do not claim a copyright on these routines, but I do ask that no
     one else do so either, :-) and that anyone using them in other pro-
     grams note their source.

     The function decrypt_member() in extract.c and the password functions
     in file_io.c were written by Mark Adler.

     The function mapped_name() in mapname.c was written by David Kirschbaum,
     based on the XXU program by Frank Da Cruz.

     Most of the remaining routines have contributions from all of us, and
     show it. :-)

   Info-ZIP comments:

   Info-ZIP has very little interest in legal matters, aside from the usual
   "CYA" sense.  In particular, Info-ZIP makes no claim as to the validity of
   the fourth copyright notice, which did not appear in any of the original 
   source code in question.  We do NOT, however, dispute the fact that Mr.
   Mascott made contributions to unzip--in fact, he was apparently responsi-
   ble for the original port to Unix on which Info-ZIP UnZip is based.  As
   an author, his wishes should be honored, regardless of any copyrights.

   Regarding the original copyright by Mr. Smith:  Info-ZIP has attempted to
   contact Mr. Smith at the BBS formerly listed in the usage screen, in order
   to comply with his first stipulation; no response was ever received, and 
   as of early 1992 the number no longer exists (hence was removed from the 
   usage screen lest it be reassigned to someone else by the phone company).
   Since the current incarnation of UnZip can be considered "our own"--it
   bears very little resemblance to his original program, in either content
   or size :-) --and since we freely distribute the source code, we feel that
   we are within the bounds of his third stipulation.  In any case, Info-ZIP
   has acted in good faith, and we hope we are not overstepping our authority.

   Info-ZIP would *like* UnZip to be distributed with minimal restrictions,
   and to that end, the authors are working to rewrite portions of the code
   where time permits.  This is a slow business, however, and it is not a
   primary concern for most of us.  So don't hold your breath. :-)
