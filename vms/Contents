  vms.h               VMS header file for UnZip
  make.com            command file to make UnZip with GNU or DEC C on VAX or AXP
  makefile            MAKE/VMS makefile for UnZip

  vmsshare.opt        options file used by descrip.mms
  bilf/bilf.c         BILF source code
  bilf/make_bilf.com  command file to compile BILF with VAX C

BILF may be required for older zipfiles or for those created under other
operating systems.  Instructions for its use are in the source code.  I'm
not sure it's of much use any more, so it may be dropped from the UnZip
distribution soon.

MAKE/VMS v3.4 is Todd Aven's 1989 make utility (Software Sweatshop, NY); 
his e-mail address is listed as todd@cincom.umd.edu.  The version used here 
has two revisions by Ned Freed (1989, 1990) and one by Greg Roelofs (1992--
options to use either creation date or revision date for determining out-of-
date-ness).  Grab quest.jpl.nasa.gov:/pub/VMS/vms_make.exe and/or vms_make.zip.
The original is at vmsa.oac.uci.edu.  [An updated version was apparently re-
leased in 3Q 93 and is available from ftp.spc.edu.]

An MMS clone called MMK (Matt's Make) is also now available and undergoing
rapid development; it too is available from ftp.spc.edu.
