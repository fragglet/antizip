  Makefile.AZT  Aztec C makefile for UnZip and fUnZip
  SMakeFile     SAS/C makefile for UnZip and fUnZip
  amiga.c       Amiga-specific file I/O routines
  amiga.h       Amiga-specific header file
  filedate.c    SetFileDate() clone for OS 1.3, based on Paul Wells' utime()
  stat.c        stat() emulation for Aztec and Lattice C
  z-stat.h      "real" stat.h header file for Aztec and Lattice C

Note:  the DICE makefile has been removed since no one is supporting that
compiler anymore.

Note also:  it was discovered on release day that the latest SAS compiler
revision (6.50 or 6.51) fixes a long-standing timezone bug, with the result
that the work-around code in UnZip now extracts files with the wrong times.
For now, either compile with the older compiler/libraries or else send e-
mail to zip-bugs; we should have a fix available shortly.
