Contents of the MAC sub-archive for UnZip 4.2 and later:

  Contents           this file
  macfile.c          Macintosh filesystem code
  macstat.c          Macintosh stat() emulation
  macstat.h          header file for stat() emulation
  unzip.make.aztec   makefile for Aztec C (binary)
  unzip.make.mpw     makefile for Mac Programmer's Workbench (binary)

No makefiles or project files were provided for the original Think C port,
but the two makefiles provided by Antoine Verheijen for Aztec C and MPW C
should be helpful anyway.  If someone comes up with a Think C makefile,
please send it in to zip-bugs for inclusion.  Mucho thanks.

The makefiles are marked "binary" because they contain a few special
characters (which look a lot like D's and 6's under Unix).  They're
basically readable, but e-mailing them without protection is likely
to strip the high bit off these characters, rendering the makefiles
less than useful.  Be forewarned...
