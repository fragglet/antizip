UnZip 5.30 for BeOS

unzip 5.30n: Compiled on BeOS 1.1DR8.2 using CodeWarrior and GNU C
             (March 15, 1997).

unzip 5.30m: Compiled on BeOS 1.1DR8.2 using GNU C/C++ (March 4, 1997),
             CodeWarrior (March 4, 1997).

unzip 5.30f: Compiled on BeOS 1.1dr8 using Metrowerks CodeWarrior (Oct 16/96).

NOTE

THIS IS A BETA!  Do not distribute it, do not put it on any other FTP/WWW
servers.  I've made these binaries available for testing purposes only.
Soon we'll relesae UnZip 5.30, with a complete Be version.

UPDATES

- compiled UnZip 5.30n
- compiles clean (w/full warnings and strict ANSI compliance) with both
  compilers
- unified the Makefiles into one spiffy Makefile that handles both
  compilers

- compiled UnZip 5.30m
- added support for GNU C/C++ (thanks to Fred Fish giving us a port; see
  ftp.ninemoons.com)
- started expanding the Be extra-field info in anticipation of DR9's new
  filesystem

- compiled UnZip 5.30f
- started using libmoto for some extra speed (of course, I haven't actually
  done any tests, but libmoto is usually a win for memory-whacking apps)
- tested UnZip 5.30f beta; cleaned up Makefile
- fixed problem with unzipping "Be" extra field info (type/creator)

FEATURES

- unzip, funzip, zipinfo, and unzipsfx all appear to work fine

KNOWN BUGS

- none, but hasn't been systematically tested

If you try this, and notice anything not working, please let me know!
